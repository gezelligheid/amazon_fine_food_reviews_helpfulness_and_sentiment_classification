exploring sentiment and helpfulness classification on the amazon fine food review dataset

Can be used to obtain a prediction on the helpfulness of a food review, which may for example in turn be used for ranking of reviews without any rating.

I didn't document it extensively. However, when the right dependencies are installed, one can quickly test the code with a test data set and one of the pre-trained models. Accuracy is upward of 83% in helpfulness prediction.
